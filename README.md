# Energy-Forecasting-for-Decision-Makers


# ⚡ Energy Forecasting & Real-Time Insights Dashboard

### Empowering Data-Driven Decisions in Renewable Energy Management

---

## 🧭 Project Summary

This project is built to address a critical need in the energy sector: transforming raw, historical energy data into accurate forecasts and insightful visualizations that empower **real-time, data-driven decisions**.

The solution delivers a full pipeline — from **data collection and modeling** to a fully interactive, cloud-deployed **dashboard**, enabling both technical teams and business stakeholders to:

- **Forecast energy generation** for wind and solar resources
- **Visualize historical and projected patterns**
- **Track key performance indicators (KPIs)** in real-time
- **Plan proactively**, minimize energy wastage, and increase transparency

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Improve Forecast Accuracy**: Apply modern time-series forecasting techniques to better predict renewable energy outputs.
- **Bridge Communication Gaps**: Create a platform that communicates data effectively to both engineers and executives.
- **Enable Proactive Planning**: Empower teams to act before issues arise through insights into trends and anomalies.
- **Increase Transparency**: Build trust through clear, accessible metrics and forecasts.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Energy companies, site managers, and policy planners often lack **real-time visibility** and **reliable forecasts** into renewable energy output. Manual reporting or fragmented tools delay decisions and lead to inefficiencies in energy distribution and resource allocation.

This project solves that by delivering:

✔️ **Accurate forecasts** using statistical and deep learning models  
✔️ **Visual dashboards** that update in real time  
✔️ **Clear KPIs** that measure what matters — capacity, generation, anomalies

## 📈 What We Did

### ✅ 1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
- Cleaned and preprocessed time-stamped energy generation data from solar and wind sites.
- Engineered powerful features like:
  - `Sunlight Proxy` from cloud cover
  - `Wind Power Proxy` using wind speed cubed
  - Temporal features: hour, day, weekday, month

### ✅ 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Identified seasonal trends and variability between solar and wind sources.
- Detected site-specific performance differences and weekly operational cycles.

### ✅ 3. **Time-Series Forecasting Models**
| Model   | Description | Strength |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Prophet** | Seasonality-aware forecasting model | Clear patterns, good interpretability |
| **ARIMA**   | Statistical model for stable series | Strong baseline comparison |
| **LSTM**    | Deep learning for complex patterns | Adaptive to long-term trends |

Each model was evaluated on a 30-day test window, with wind consistently easier to predict than solar due to lower seasonal volatility.

### ✅ 4. **Real-Time Dashboard Development**
Built using **Streamlit**, the dashboard allows users to:
- Interact with forecast graphs (solar/wind)
- Filter by site, season, day type
- View KPIs like average daily energy, peak generation, and capacity utilization
- Monitor 30-day predictions updated in real time

## 💼 Stakeholder Benefits

| Role               | Benefit |
|--------------------|---------|
| **Energy Managers** | Optimize resource use and downtime scheduling |
| **Executives**      | View live KPIs and production trends |
| **Engineers**       | Drill into site-specific performance and patterns |
| **Analysts**        | Access cleaned, modeled data for deep dives |

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The entire app is deployable via **Render**, allowing secure access by authorized users anywhere. It integrates with GitHub for continuous updates and version control.

Deployment includes:
- `requirements.txt` for environment setup
- `render.yaml` for cloud configuration
- Streamlit-based UI for responsive visualization

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Solar output is highly seasonal and weather-dependent, requiring robust models.
- Wind is more stable, making it easier to forecast accurately.
- Combining traditional models (Prophet/ARIMA) with LSTM gives a powerful hybrid approach.
- Visualization is the bridge between modeling complexity and stakeholder impact.
